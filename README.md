A/B Testing
Experiment - Udacity


_Summary and Recommendation_

In this experiment, an A/B test is performed to measure the effect of and additional screen at Udacity, which asks for the hours devoted a week to the students and gives an advice that if the amount of hours given by the user is less than 5 hours, itâ€™d be better to access the course content without enrollment. Sanity checks have been done using three metrics to make sure that control and experiment groups are created unbaised. Two evaluation metrics were used which are Gross Conversion (enrollment per cookie) and Net Conversion (payments per cookie). In the end, it is found that result for Gross Conversion is practically significant, but result for Net Conversion is not even statistically significant.

This result means that, even though number of enrolled students has been decreased significantly, number of payments did not. This was the exact aim of the experiment to show, therefore I recommend to launch the change at this point.

The whole report is in the repository.
